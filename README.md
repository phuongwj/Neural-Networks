# Neural-Networks

This repository contains the implementation of single-layer perceptron, training and evaluating a multi-layer perceptron using scikit-learn.

## Main Goal

The goal is to:

1. Implement a single-layer perceptron, train the model on a small synthetic 2D dataset, and visualize the decision boundary at the end of training.
2. Train a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden layer by using MLPClassifier from sklearn, and plot the decision regions.
3. Adapt the implementation of the multi-layer perceptron from part 2 to work with the Two Moons dataset, and also plot the decision regions.
4. Try different MLP architectures.
